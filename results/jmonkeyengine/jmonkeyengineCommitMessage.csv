"Android native image loader rewritten from scratch
 * Now supports reading directly from Java InputStream instead of having to read image file into memory first
 * Optimized native code - reduced unneccessary memory copies"
"android native improvements
 * rename jme_stbi -> jme_decode, which is a new native library that will handle image and audio decoding in native code
 * add a special version of tremor designed to run on android
 * adjust the build process to handle these changes"
"native bullet:
- add ray test code, thanks to @EmpirePhoenix
- clean up import structure
- remove separate jmeUserPointer class

"PhysicsSpace: add method to set solver iterations
Thanks to Seppes (see thread: http://hub.jmonkeyengine.org/t/how-to-access-native-bullets-constraintsolver-numiterations)"
"Bullet PhysicsRigigBody : added set/getAngularFactor(Vector3f) and set/getLinearFactor(Vector3f), these methods are usefull for locking axis translations or rotation"
"More work on vorbis decoder
 * added support for decoding from a section of a file descriptor (needed if decoding from an asset inside APK)
 * implemented seek function"
add native android lib for loading png and gif files.  Does not premultiply.  Uses stb_image (http://www.nothings.org/stb_image.c)
